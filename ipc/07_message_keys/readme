A message queue works kind of like a FIFO, but supports some additional 
functionality. Generally, see, messages are taken off the queue in the order 
they are put on. Specifically, however, there are ways to pull certain messages 
out of the queue before they reach the front.

Most important functions:

1. Connect to (create) a queue:
int msgget(key_t key, int msgflg);


2. Handling keys

3. Sending to the queue

4. Receiving from the queue
